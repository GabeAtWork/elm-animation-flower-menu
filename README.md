# elm-html-animation-flower-menu

This is a recreation of a lovely design for [a menu made by Nash Vail](https://medium.com/@nashvail/a-gentle-introduction-to-react-motion-dc50dd9f2459#.bgck7roe9)

His original code was written in React using the React Motion library and I wanted to see how this would translate into the [Elm programming language](ttp://elm-lang.org/) using the [elm-html-animation](https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-html-animation) library.


# Installation

Download the elm platform if you don't have it.  Clone this repository and run the following.
